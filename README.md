# AI-Powered Chat Library

This library allows you to integrate an AI-powered chat component into your React application. The chat component uses the OpenAI API to generate intelligent responses based on user input.

## Installation

To use the AI-powered chat library in your React application, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:


npm install rca-react-chatai

#Import the Chat component from the library into your React application
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

import ChatLibrary from "rca-react-chatai";


#USAGE
---------------------------------------------------------
Once you have imported the ChatLibrary component, you can use it in your application as follows:

Copy code:
-----------



//from the video link at the bottom copy the constants that I highlighted that are required for this library to function that I stated   .         


export default App;



#Custom Styling
-------------------------------------------

The chat component comes with default styling, but you can customize it to match your application's design. To do this, you can override the CSS classes provided by the library.

For example, to change the input and button styles, you can add your own CSS:

css
----


/* custom.css */
.response_container {
  /* modify the styles of the response container ( the container that has the response )*/
}

div {
  /* you can modify the styles of the div that holds them all */
}

Then, import your custom CSS in your React application:
--

import React from "react";
import ChatLibrary from "rca-react-chatai";
import "./custom.css"; // Import your custom styles

The chat component will now use your custom styles for the input and button.

#Real-World Use Cases
